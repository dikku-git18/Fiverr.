## Introduction:
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based platform that serves as a marketplace for sellers and clients to connect, collaborate, and transact business. The platform facilitates the buying and selling of services (referred to as "gigs") across various categories, allowing sellers to offer their skills and expertise to potential clients.
## Features:
#### User Registration and Authentication:
 * Users can register on the platform by providing necessary information such as email, username, and password.
#### User Profile Management:
  * Users can create and manage their profiles, including personal information, and relevent skills to present themselves effectively to potential clients.
#### Gig Creation and Listing:
  * Sellers can create gigs representing the services they offer, including detailed descriptions, pricing, sample images, delivery time, and optional add-ons.
  And, Gigs are categorized based on service type or industry, making it easier for clients to find relevant services.
#### Browsing and Search Functionality:
  * Clients can browse through available gigs, filter by category or criteria, and search for specific services using keywords.
#### Order Placement and Management:
  * Clients can place orders for gigs directly through the platform, specifying project requirements and any additional details.
#### Payment Processing:
* The platform supports secure payment processing, allowing clients to pay for services using online payment gateways.
#### Communication and Collaboration:
* Built-in messaging systems enable seamless communication between clients and freelancers, facilitating discussions, clarifications, and negotiations.
#### Feedback and Rating System:
* Upon completion of an order, clients and freelancers can leave feedback and ratings based on their experience.
